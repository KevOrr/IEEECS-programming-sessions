# programming-challenges

This repository houses all of my solutions to various programming challenge sites

### Codewars
[Codewars][codewars] is a great site for ramping up your programming skills in a variety of
languages (20 as of this commit and they're adding support for more). My profile is
[here][codewars profile].

### Dailyprogrammer
Redditors who frequent [r/dailyprogrammer][dailyprogrammer] post daily challenges ranging
from easy to hard. All languages that [the ideone API][ideone] supports are accepted, and
even then, languages that ideone does not yet support are more than welcome.

### HackerRank
Much like codewars, [HackerRank][hackerrank] is a site that provides challenges rangin from
"Helloo, World!" to AI and security. My profile is [here][hackerrank profile].
