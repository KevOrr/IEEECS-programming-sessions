# Programming Challenges

This repository houses all of my solutions to various programming challenge sites. Can't
guarantee that all examples will work out-of-the-box, but feel free to open issues.

### Advent of Code
From the [Advent of Code][advent] about page:

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

### Codewars
[Codewars][codewars] is a great site for ramping up your programming skills in a variety of
languages (20 as of this commit and they're adding support for more). My profile is
[here][codewars profile].

### Dailyprogrammer
Redditors who frequent [r/dailyprogrammer][dailyprogrammer] post daily challenges ranging
from easy to hard. All languages that [the ideone API][ideone] supports can be run to verify
correctness, and even then, languages that ideone does not yet support are more than welcome.

### HackerRank
Much like codewars, [HackerRank][hackerrank] is a site that provides challenges ranging from
"Hello, World!" to AI and security. My profile is [here][hackerrank profile].
