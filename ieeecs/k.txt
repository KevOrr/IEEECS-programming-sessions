IEEEXtreme 6.0 Question AA

In a forest, there were 'x' bunnies, 50% male, and 50% female, all adults. Bunnies doubles every 15 days,
10% of the baby rabbits dies at birth. They mature after 30 days, 30% leave the forest, and rest becomes
rabbits. In every 30 days , 25% dies off due to flu. If every bunny dies off, the bunny world ends.
Calculate the final number of bunnies alive after 1 year for any number of initial bunnies, x.


Your program should write back to the standard output. When all bunnies die off, write 0 to the standard
