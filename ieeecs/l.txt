IEEEXtreme 6.0 Question AG

We have two tanks that we can fill them with water. We know beforehand the volume of each tank,
however, there is no other measurement to see how much water there is in each tank. For example, we
can have a tank of 1lt and one of 3lt, and we can‟t fill the second tank up to 2lt by just looking – we are
only sure if we already know how much water already exists in one tank and how much water we are
putting in. What we can do is one of the following three(3) valid moves: A) Empty a tank, B) Fill up a tank
from a faucet that has unlimited supply, C) Move water to one tank from the other one until the first one
fills up or the second one to dry, and if there is remaining water, it is kept or thrown away.

You will be given the volume of each of the two tanks, and also the volume of water we want to find, and
you are asked to answer with the minimum number of moves to be done, according to the description, so
as to reach the goal, if there is one.

The output will contain just one line containing the minimum number of moves to be done to reach the
goal, or the word „no‟, in case there is no solution.
